**`Digital Craftsman (Developer)`**

I'm a passionate software developer building and improving myself up one project at a time, I'm fascinated by everything related to tech and science, and have a deep desire to learn the unknown, I love building projects from the ground up, designing the architecture, planing the process to go from a blank folder to a remarkable product, clean architecture and making scalable code is something really strive for.
